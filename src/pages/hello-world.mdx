# Hello world !

## A minimal app

What is the minimal front-end app possible ?
To its core, it's just a (pure) function that renders some user interfaces elements on screen.
In a webapp those UI elements are modeled by a tree structure object, known as the DOM.
Optionnaly this function can have an input, and we'll call that input the state of the app.

```tsx
declare const App: (input: AppState) => HTMLElement
```

Translated into React terms, the minimal app is a one component App.
The input of this component is called **Props** (short for properties);
and contrary to bare metal JS app, UI elements are not represented by the DOM
but by an other intermediary structure called **vDOM**.

```tsx
import React from 'react'

interface AppState {
  hello: string
}

declare const App: (props: AppState) => React.ReactNode
```

## Bootstraping

But to actually render anything on the screen our component/app/function needs to be called,
and it's result (the vDOM elements) need to be interpredeted/translated into real DOM elements.
In order to do, because the package `react` is platform agnostic (it only handles vdom diffing, state, side effects, etc...)
you'll need to import from a new package `react-dom` the function `render`, it'will reconcile the vDOM and the actual DOM.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import { App } from './App'

ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(App, {
    hello: 'world',
  }),
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

The render function also need the reference to an existing dom element to "mount" the entire app into it,
you'll need to pass this ref as the second argument of the render function.
In the rest of this tutorial you'll not have to worry about mounting your app/component, you'll be coding inside another app (this one) already bootstraped into the DOM.

## JSX vs React.createElement

```tsx
React.createElement(type, [props], [...children])
```

Create and return a new React element of the given type. The type argument can be either a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), a React component type (a class or a function), or a React fragment type.
Code written with JSX will be converted to use React.createElement(). You will not typically invoke React.createElement() directly if you are using JSX.

For example, this piece of JSX/TSX :

```tsx
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Big title</h1>
    <MyAwesomeComp
      size="sm"
      content={{
        datum: 42,
      }}
    />
  </div>
)
```

It will be converted by the parser (tsc or babel) into :

```tsx
const App = () =>
  React.createElement(
    'div',
    null,
    React.createElement('h1', null, 'Big title'),
    React.createElement(MyAwesomeComp, {
      size: 'sm',
      content: {
        datum: 42,
      },
    }),
  )
```

A few thing to remember when using JSX :

- JSX native elements are writem in lower case `<div></div>, <hr />...`
- Your component are written in Pascal case `<MyComp />, <NavMenu></NavMenu>`
- Every component can be written as a self closing tag if it has no children `<div />, <hr />`
- You need `import React from 'react'` on top of your file - even if you don't write it `React.createElement` will still be called.
- You can nest any JS/TS **expression** using curling `{}`.

```tsx
// it can be used to escape children
<div>{`This is a string template ${props.name} !`}</div>

// or it can be used to escape props
<MyBox fontSize={16}>A text children</MyBox>

// any expression can be used (ternary operator is an expression, not if else block)
<MyBox fontSize={size === 'sm' ? 12 : 18} />

// don't be fooled it's no special syntax, we just are just injecting a litteral object
<MyBox complexObjProps={{ shorty: 42, biggy: NaN }} />

// Shorthand syntax for string props
<MyBox gap={'kinda-big'} />
<MyBox gap="kinda-big" />

// you can even deep nest JSX elements
<GoldenLayout
  side={<NavMenu item1={true} />}
  main={myCondition ? <Page index={21} /> : <Alert />}
/>
```

## Put it all together

You've got a small interactive example below of our minimal app.
For now we won't worry about how the state of the app is handle,
you can tweak the injected props in the _PROPS_ tab.

<SnippetPreview
  file="snip01"
  initProps={{
    name: 'John Doe',
    lang: 'fr',
  }}
/>
