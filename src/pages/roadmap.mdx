# Roadmap

- What is React ? What problem does it solve ? What it is not ?
- Hello world !
  - What is the minimal app ? it's a function that has an input (state) and output a model of the UI (VDom).
  - React jobs is to render this model the most efficient way (it tries to optimize repaint call, doing the dirty imperative error-prone job for you).
  - Bootstraping aka rendering your app ? ReactDOM.render
  - The UI model aka the VDOM ? React.createElement(type: "div", props?: Props, ...children: React.ReactNode[]): React.ReactNode <==> JSX
  - **Exercice 0** : Look at how this example is set-up, will not go into the bundling, setting dev tool. Mention CRA / Parcel / Gatbsy / Nextjs.
- Children !
  - Parent to children communication aka passing down props ? TS prop types, special children attribute, React.ReactNode type
  - Exercice 1 :
    You have an App component to complete, it receive a character sheet for RPG as prop (`{ characSheet: Record<string, number>, sort: 'ALPHA' | 'RANDOM' }`)
    Assets => Wireframe + label component + an number input + layout css
    Bonus : Try to make the sort feature
  - Learn about diffing + key props
  - The slot pattern aka the React.Node type.
  - Exercice 1 Bis : Go back and do the sort and thinking about perf + separating layout and cell comp (`{ renderCell: ([string, number]) => React.Node }`)
- The HP bar
  - le compteur, cf useState => local state management
  - Pure/Impure, Dumb/smart, the container pattern (for storybook, testing, refactoring)
  - Excercie 2 : Making the dumb Hp bar `<HpBar value={4} max={10} labels={['-6', '-4', '-2']} />`
  - Children to parent => using callbacks (withou useCallback), no double binding
  - Exercice 3: Create container with local state + handle click
- Effects !
  - Fetch charac sheet from API, see https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-hooks-fetch-data
- character vault
  - CRUD reducer + immer + lift state up into context
- Virtual table (intro to three )
- Routing between different character sheets
  - React router
