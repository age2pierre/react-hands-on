# What is react ?

## What Wikipedia says about it

> React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
> It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
>
> React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
> However, React is only concerned with rendering data to the DOM, and so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for state management and routing.
> Redux and React Router are respective examples of such libraries.

Contrary to Angular, which aims at solving everything problem in front-end dev (http call, routing, renderering...).
One is a library, the other a framework. One gives you choice, the other headaches ðŸ˜œ.

## What React says about itself

The 3 design principles they advertise are :

> - **Declarative:**
>   React makes it painless to create interactive UIs.
>   Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
>   Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
> - **Component-Based:**
>   Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
>   Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.

No more `*ngFor="let item of items; index as i; trackBy: trackByFn"` or other made-up syntax.
Most of the time you will use JSX/TSX to write view.
It's an extension to ECMACSCRIPT, meaning writing JSX is equivalent 1-1 to writing JS.
It was created for react but is now usable with other project, see [spec](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/)

> - **Learn Once, Write Anywhere:**
>   We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.
>   React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using.

`without rewriting existing code.` that much is a lie, each target will need it's own render component.
But you could share a large part of your logic.
