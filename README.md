# Hands on react + TS

This a very opiniated tutorial for react beginner.
I've chosen to _only_ speak about certain API (hooks, context, function component)
to show the expressivity and simplicity of the library.
We will also use some library of the very vast React ecosystem,
they may not be all the indsutry standards, but were chosen to be fun and usefull.
For prop typings (and more) we'll heavely rely on Typescript.

## Start the tutorial

You'll need **Node** installed on your machine.
To download and install all the dependecies of the project, run `npm i`.
Then start the project, run `npm run start`.
Open `localhost:1234` and follow the steps from there.
