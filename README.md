# Hands on react + TS

This a very opiniated tutorial for react beginner.
I've chosen to _only_ speak about certain API (hooks, context, function component)
to show the expressivity and simplicity of the library.
We will also use some library of the very vast React ecosystem,
they may not be all the indsutry standards, but were chosen to be fun and usefull.
For prop typings (and more) we'll heavely rely on Typescript.

## Instalation

You'll need **Node** installed on your machine.

1. Run `npm i` to install packages
1. Run `npm start` to run dev server
1. Open `localhost:1234` and follow the steps from there.

If you use VSCode we recommend to install the following extensions for optimal DX,
it will set you up with format and lint on save, plus a few refactor action codes and graphql autocomplete :
